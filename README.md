# vuex-action-reload

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vuex-action-reload.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/vuex-action-reload)

A vuex plugin that reloads actions when a condition is met.

This handles the situation where a certain change in the vuex store requires other
parts of the store to change. Ideally, the parts that should change are handled
by dispatching actions (e.g. calling a remote API).

An example of this would be changing the locale of your app, thus requiring a
reload of all locale-dependent parts of your vuex store.

## Installation

```
npm install vuex-action-reload
```

## Usage

```
import createVuexReloadPlugin from 'vuex-action-reload'

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    createVuexReloadPlugin({
      actions: ['loadNews', 'Posts/loadLatest'],
      condition: mutation => mutation.type === 'Locale/setLocale'
      })
    ]
})

```

In this example, the actions `loadNews` and `Posts/loadLatest` will be dispatched
every time a mutation of `Locale/setLocale` occurs.

## API

```
createVuexReloadPlugin([options])
```

Creates a new instance of the plugin with the given options.
The following options can be provided to configure the plugin for your specific needs:

* `actions <Array>` an array of actions that should be "reloaded" (dispatched)
when `condition` is met

* `condition <Function:Boolean>` A function returning a Boolean deciding which store mutations
should trigger a reload of `actions`. This function receives an object from vuex
containing `type` (name of mutation) and `payload` (the payload the mutation receives).
